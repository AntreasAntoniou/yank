# Homebrew Cask for Yank.
#
# Publish this from a tap repo (e.g. github.com/AntreasAntoniou/homebrew-tap)
# so users can:  brew install --cask antreasantoniou/tap/yank
#
# The `sha256` below is an all-zero PLACEHOLDER. It is NOT a real checksum and
# this cask MUST NOT be published with it. On each release, replace it with the
# sha256 of the RELEASED DMG (Yank-<version>.dmg): the release CI computes and
# prints it — see Scripts/release.sh (which packages the DMG) and
# .github/workflows/release.yml ("Compute DMG checksum" → `shasum -a 256`, also
# surfaced as "SHA-256:" in the published release notes). Bump `version` too.
#
# Two backstops prevent shipping the placeholder by accident:
#   1. Scripts/release.sh aborts the release if this file still holds the
#      all-zero sha (the authoritative, publish-blocking guard).
#   2. The Ruby preflight below raises if the all-zero sha reaches `brew`,
#      gated to non-development use so local cask hacking still works.

  # Belt-and-braces: refuse to install/audit a cask that still carries the
  # all-zero placeholder sha256. Gated to non-development runs so `--debug`/local
  # cask editing is unaffected; the real publish-blocking guard lives in
  # Scripts/release.sh. Kept side-effect-free so `ruby -c` / `brew` parsing pass.
