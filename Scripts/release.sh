# release.sh — build, Developer-ID sign, notarize, staple, and package Yank as a
# distributable DMG. Designed to be runnable TODAY (it degrades gracefully to a
# self-signed local DMG) and to "just work" once you have an Apple Developer ID.
#
# One-time setup (needs an Apple Developer Program membership):
#   1. In Xcode > Settings > Accounts, create a "Developer ID Application" cert,
#      or download it from developer.apple.com. Find its name:
#         security find-identity -p codesigning -v | grep "Developer ID Application"
#   2. Store a notarization profile in your keychain (no password in this script):
#         xcrun notarytool store-credentials ditto-notary \
#            --apple-id "you@example.com" --team-id "ABCDE12345"
#      (use an app-specific password from appleid.apple.com)
#
# Then release with:
#   DEVID="Developer ID Application: Your Name (ABCDE12345)" \
#   NOTARY_PROFILE="ditto-notary" \
#   bash Scripts/release.sh
#

# script packages the DMG; CI's "Compute DMG checksum" step prints that hash —
# see .github/workflows/release.yml). Refuse to cut a release while the cask
# still carries the placeholder, so a zero-sha (= unverifiable) install can never
# be published. A real (non-zero) sha passes this check untouched. Set
# ALLOW_PLACEHOLDER_SHA=1 only for a deliberate dry run that won't be published.
