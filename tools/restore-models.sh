# restore-models.sh — reproducibly materialise the on-device ogma CoreML models
# into the exact tools/models/ layout that Scripts/build-app.sh expects, WITHOUT
# committing large binaries to git.
#
# The .mlpackage CoreML files are NOT published; they are produced LOCALLY by
# converting the public PyTorch weights from HuggingFace. This script:
#   1. downloads each ogma repo's PyTorch source (weights + tokenizer + config)
#      via tools/_dl.py  (→ tools/models/<name>/)
#   2. converts it to CoreML via tools/convert_ogma.py
#      (→ tools/models/<name>.mlpackage, with a parity check)
#
# Result for each <name> in MODELS, exactly what build-app.sh consumes:
#   tools/models/<name>.mlpackage
#   tools/models/<name>/{tokenizer.json,tokenizer_config.json,config.json}
#
# Idempotent: a model is skipped if its .mlpackage + tokenizer.json already exist
# (so a restored CI cache is reused for free).
#
# Requirements (install once before running):
#   pip install torch transformers coremltools sentencepiece safetensors huggingface_hub
# Python 3.10 is fine — tools/_compat.py provides the StrEnum shim ogma needs.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/restore-models.sh                      # restore the default set
#   MODELS="ogma-micro" tools/restore-models.sh  # restore a subset
#   HF_REPO_PREFIX=axiotic tools/restore-models.sh
#
# NOTE: the ogma models are CC-BY-NC-4.0 (attribution to Jina AI teacher model).
